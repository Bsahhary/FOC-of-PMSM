# FOC-of-PMSM
Field-Oriented Control of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Using NXP™ S32K144 Development kit

This example implements a motor control system using the NXP™ MCSPTE1AK144 hardware. The MCSPTE1AK144 development kit, which uses the NXP™ S32K144 microcontroller, can run motor control applications designed for either a three-phase brushless DC (BLDC) or three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM).


## Setup 
To Run:
1. Download the package and extract the contents.
2. Refer to the document 'mcb_nxp_MCSPTE1AK144_example_doc.pdf' for detailed instructions.
